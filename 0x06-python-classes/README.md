# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Description
This repository contains Python scripts that implement the concept of classes and objects.

## Files
- **0-square.py**: An empty class `Square` is defined.

- **1-square.py**: Defines a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size` and instantiation with size.

- **2-square.py**: Extends the `Square` class from task 1 to include size validation.

- **3-square.py**: Adds a public instance method `area` to calculate the current square area.

- **4-square.py**: Enhances the `Square` class by adding property getters and setters for the `size` attribute.

- **5-square.py**: Introduces a public instance method `my_print` that prints the square using the `#` character.

- **6-square.py**: Further extends the `Square` class by adding a private instance attribute `position` and a public instance method `my_print` that considers the position.

## Usage
To test these scripts, you can use the provided `main` files. For example:
```bash
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
# ... and so on
```
